# [Music Contractor](https://music-contractor.herokuapp.com/)

Music Contractor is a web app designed to improve the hiring process for orchestra contractors.  When an organizer of a musical production creates an event and selects musicians, an email list is created.  A call to the [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) API is then used to email those musicians and invite them to play the event in a professional and efficient way.  Musicians can then log in to their profiles to view the details of the event and accept or decline the gig.  A personnel roster in the event profile is updated according to each musician's reply status to indicate booking confirmation.  Additional technologies include Javascript, Materialize CSS, HTML5, Angular, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Knex and Heroku.
